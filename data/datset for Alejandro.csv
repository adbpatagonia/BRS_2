The result of these small course changes, as the whales approached the sound source, was an increase in the distance between the whales and the source at the closest point of apsroach. This ""avoidancen behavior resulted in a lower sound level exposure than would have occurred had the whale maintained the original course.  In a study of migratory gray whales exposed to seismic and other industrial signals , Malme et aL (1983, 1984), showed avoidance responses to all of the sound stimuli used in this study. In that study whales were on well-directed migratory tracks and hence the track analysis scores were very sensitive to slight dfelections in the whales' swimming patterns. The incidence of breaching and milling periods during the five industrial noise playbacks were not significantly different. There was also no significant difference when these two behavioral categories were compared to the control periods. The milling period sample was, however, very small. There were significantly more surface active behavior periods during the Semisubmersible Rig playback. This result could not be explained in terms of sound exposure level.

However, when the pooled playbacks with Semisubmersible Rig data (but without Helicopter data) were compared to the two control conditions, no significant difference was found. The incidence of direction change periods during the five playbacks was significantly different with a high number of direction changes during the Drilling Platform playback. a concerted effort was made to note whale group behaviors such as surface activity, milling, and breaching during control and experimental conditions so that any potential relationship to industrial sound exposure level could be determined.
